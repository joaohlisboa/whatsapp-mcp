# Allowed tools for Claude Code CLI
# Controls which tools Claude can use when responding to WhatsApp messages
# Examples:
#   "*" - Allow all tools (default)
#   "Read Write Edit" - Allow only file operations
#   "Bash(ls:*) Bash(pwd) Read" - Allow only ls commands, pwd, and Read
#   "mcp__whatsapp mcp__google-workspace Read" - Allow specific MCP servers and Read
#   "" - Allow no tools (Claude will only be able to respond with text)

# Note: MCP servers (like Google Workspace, WhatsApp) are configured separately
# in their own Docker containers with their own .env files.
# Claude Code CLI will automatically discover and connect to them via
# the Claude Extensions configuration in ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/
